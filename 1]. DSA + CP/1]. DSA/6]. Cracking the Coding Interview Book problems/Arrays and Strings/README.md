**Below are the questions for Arrays and Strings**:

1.1 Is Unique: Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?

1.2 Check Permutation: Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.

1.3 URLify: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional
    characters and that you are given the "true" length of the string.
    
    Example
    Input: "Mr John Smith "
    Output: "Mr%20John%20Smith"
    
1.4 Palindrome Permutation: Given a string, write a method to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome.

1.5 One Away: There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, 
    write a function to check if they are one edit(or zero edit) away.
    
1.6 Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2b1c5a3.

1.7 Rotate matrix: Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees.

1.8 Zero Matrix: Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column are set to zero.

1.9 String rotation: Assume you have a method isSubstring which checks if one word is a substring of another. Given two strings, s1 and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to isSubstring.
