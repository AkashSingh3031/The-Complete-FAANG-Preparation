### Use STAR technique
Use the STAR Method. You should be familiar with this strategy so you can implement it in your answers. This is a great way to guarantee that your answer has structure and includes all the information that the interviewer is looking for. You should make a point of using STAR when answering all behavioral interview questions.

ST – Situation or task. To begin, establish the situation you were in. For this question in particular, you will be describing a problem you faced, so you can include information about how it was a bad situation to contrast with the positive solution you will eventually reach.

A – Action. When answering this question, the action section will be the most important and the most extensive. You should describe the specific actions that you took to resolve the problem or disagreement. You should be sure to include details.

R – Results. Finally, emphasizing the results of your actions is very important. You should describe how you resolved the issue and how successful the project was because of the cooperation you established.

### Use these words while answering
- Structure
- Time-management
- Persistence
- Determination

### Here are some of the best practice examples of cultural interview questions:
1. Describe the type of work environment in which you can really give your best and be most productive.
```
I have worked in many types of environments and enjoyed learning new things from each.
I am quite flexible in terms of work environment and would like to work in an exciting fast-paced environment, 
working with people who are committed to getting things done and who are passionate about their work.
```

2. Describe a situation where your colleagues disagreed with your ideas. What did you do?
```
A few team members, including myself, were tasked to make new mobile application to improve efficiency while prioritizing customer satisfaction. 
I was mostly concerned with meeting all of the customers’ needs, but a coworker was concerned that I was not following our instructions by neglecting efficiency. 
At first it seemed like we were in total conflict, but I was able to get him to realize that we were each concerned with two halves of the solution. 
Only by combining our two contributions would we be able to succeed. We focused on the areas we excelled in and found a way to fit them together, creating a procedure that is still in use with the company and improved efficiency.
```

3. When you have completed a difficult task or project
```
The most challenging situation for me, I would say was in my internship my team was dealing with a big project. 
All the employees were very serious about this BIG PROJECT because it was one of the largest projects in monetary terms that the company had ever received. 
The project was, however, in our reach and we would have done it without much of hustling. But, the problem arose here when one of our software expert resigned in the middle of the project and our work halted. 
Since I had some experience with required softare technology, I was asked to do it for that Big Project. It was quite a time since I had done that work. I was afraid that I won’t be able to do it. But, I recalled all that I have learned and gave it a shot and hit the bull’s eye.
