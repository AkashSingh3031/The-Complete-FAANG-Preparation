### Use STAR technique
Use the STAR Method. You should be familiar with this strategy so you can implement it in your answers. This is a great way to guarantee that your answer has structure and includes all the information that the interviewer is looking for. You should make a point of using STAR when answering all behavioral interview questions.

ST – Situation or task. To begin, establish the situation you were in. For this question in particular, you will be describing a problem you faced, so you can include information about how it was a bad situation to contrast with the positive solution you will eventually reach.

A – Action. When answering this question, the action section will be the most important and the most extensive. You should describe the specific actions that you took to resolve the problem or disagreement. You should be sure to include details.

R – Results. Finally, emphasizing the results of your actions is very important. You should describe how you resolved the issue and how successful the project was because of the cooperation you established.

### Use these words while answering
- Structure
- Time-management
